        <div class="container-fluid bio">
          <p>My name is Collin Hooper. Born in the late 90s in Grand Rapids, Michigan, I find myself learning all I possibly can about front- and backend development and applying that knowledge to my expanding portfolio of projects. I always knew
            that I would end up working with technology, but the story of how I made up my mind on stack development is one that I think is worth telling.</p>
          <p>Rockford High School offered a lot of resources to budding professionals, like a strong foreign language department, but unfortunately did not offer much in the way of computer science of programming. Originally, I wanted to be in the
            CIA, and figured my knack for learning foreign languages would be conducive to that dream. Holding myself to the strict code that potential employees can find on the CIA's website, I yearned for the experience of travelling to foreign
            lands, and because I was learning the language, I had my eyes on Germany. First, I wanted to do a year abroad in high school, but because I would still have had to repeat a year upon my return, that option became invalid. I figured I
            would try for a year abroad again while I was attending college; after all, I was planning on studying foreign languages at an in-state university. After speaking with my German teacher and a year of obtaining particular certifications,
            it was clear that I could and would attend a German university for the entirety of my degree.</p>
          <p>I was an American in Germany, and a German student of Political Science. Here I had my first experience with programming (RStudio), playing guitar, and many of the other things that I enjoy to this day. I went to Germany seeking a path
            to become a lawyer. I am now certain that software development is my industry-of-choice to make an impact on.</p>
